potluk
======

*a service for organizing who brings what to where*

## What?

In short, putluk will allow a person to organize a list of attendees for an event as well as allow each attendee to tell what they are bringing. My hope is that events created with potluk can be integrated into facebook, google+ and/or other services.

## Why?

This is definitely a work in progress and an opportunity to work on a few things like

- creating and securing an api
- working with and integrating with external api's like facebook
- implement oauth
- maybe write in rails or node (probably laravel though)
